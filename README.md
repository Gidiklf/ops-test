# Vim DevOps Interview

Welcome to Vim's hands-on exercise for DevOps engineer!

Your goal this exercise is to build a funcitoning CI & CD pipeline for this repo. The only limitions you have is that you pack the application in a docker contianer and store it in DockerHub.

Before starting the exercise we reommend that you:
- Fork this repo to have admin access.
- Open the interview kit and make sure you are able to connect to all the provided resources.

### Some Pointers:
- Plan ahead! Let us know if you need additional access or need us to make changes you don't have permissions to make.
- Think production application, it's a very simple use case so you don't need to build something super robust, but we do expect you to apply your best practices for security, versioning, stability and avilability.
- We beleive in infra-as-code, so the more of your work you can store in this repo the better.
- You can use as many free 3rd party tools or open source as you like excluding hosting solutions. The application must be deployed the provided EC2 host.
- Bouns points - Replace this readme with domunentation of the pipeline you've built!
- Have fun with it and don't be shy of showing of ;)
